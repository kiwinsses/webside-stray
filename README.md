# website-for-a-favorite-game
Website for a personally selected topic

This site was my final grade for a course 'HTML & CSS' in my second year. We had to make a website on a topic of your choice using HTML and CSS, no database or back-end needed.
My theme of choice was 'Stray' -  an indie game by a French studio that was just released at the time. Using the style of the game, I created a site for cat (or animal, however there are only cats in the game) adopting.
**Final grade: 5.00 / B **
